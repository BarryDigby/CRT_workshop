VSCode
======

`Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_  or VSCode for short, is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. VSCode has a huge ecosystem of packages that can be installed to extend functionality.

The creators of ``nf-core`` have put together a collection of extension packages to make it easier to get up and running when working with nf-core pipelines.

You can browse, pick and choose the ones you think look good, or can install them all in a single click.

To use, just search for ``nf-core-extensionpack`` in the VSCode Packages tab search bar, or visit `<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nf-core.nf-core-extensionpack>`_

Link to Github
--------------

VScode should prompt you to sign in to your Github account. Enter you account details, and test it out by cloning a repository locally. Once you open the directory in VSCode, you will be able to perform every Github action ``add, pull, push, commit, merge, etc..`` within VSCode which is not only more efficient, but also easier to track changes.
