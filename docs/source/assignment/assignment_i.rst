Assignment I
============

Update your ``main.nf`` script to complete the ``kallisto`` RNA-Seq quantification steps. 

Refer to the `Kallisto documentation <https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/manual>`_ and inspect the ``kaliisto quant`` arguments. 

Before designing a nextflow workflow, you need to be familiar with the expected outputs generated by the script body. Shell into your container to run the quantification analysis in bash before implementing the process in nextflow. 

Help
----

We will try to treat this like a proper hackathon. If you need help, let me know and I will clone your GitHub repository and checkout a branch for you and make the appropriate comments. It is up to you the implement the changes and merge the branch back to ``dev``. 

Please use correct indentation, it is easier for me to spot mistakes.
